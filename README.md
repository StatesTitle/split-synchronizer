# Split Synchronizer 
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/split-synchronizer.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/split-synchronizer)

## Overview
By default, Split’s SDKs keep segment and split data synchronized as users navigate across disparate systems, treatments, and conditions. However, some languages, do not have a native capability to keep a shared local cache of this data to properly serve treatments. For these cases, we built the Split Synchronizer.

## Compatibility
Split Synchronizer supports Go version 1.8 or higher.

## Deploying to Heroku
1. Create a Heroku app by going to the [private space](https://dashboard.heroku.com/teams/states-title/spaces) you want to add the new synchronizer to
2. Set the image as container via 
> `heroku stack:set container -a <app_name>`
3. Add the go language pack via 
> `heroku buildpacks:set heroku/go -a <app_name>`
4. Push this codebase to the newly created app via 
> `git push https://git.heroku.com/<app_name>.git master:master`
5. Add the appropriate API key from Split's `Admin Settings->Workspace settings->API keys` as an environment variable `SPLIT_SYNC_API_KEY`

See [How to deploy Synchronizer Docker Container in Heroku](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033291832-How-to-deploy-Synchronizer-Docker-Container-in-Heroku-) for details.

### Doma specific changes
[Heroku Redis cycles credentials/Redis URLs periodically](https://help.heroku.com/VN3D085X/why-have-my-heroku-redis-credentials-changed), and that would invalidate the environment variables that were derived from that Redis URL, which would break the synchronizer's functionality. 

We opted to parse the Redis URL that is autogenerated by the Heroku Redis attachment such that the regenerated Redis URL gets translated into the environment variables the synchronizer needs in `entrypoint.sh` instead. 

This allows us to both keep our synchronizer functional even after credential/Redis URL updates and avoid redundancy in our environment variables.
